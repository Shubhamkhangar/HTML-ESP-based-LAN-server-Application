# HTML-ESP-based-LAN-server-Application

The project implements a web server on ESP8266 microcontrollers, enabling control of LEDs and display of sensor data through a web interface. The system allows users to interact with the microcontroller remotely only within the personal area network by toggling LEDs on and off and retrieving sensor data via a user-friendly web page. The implementation includes WebSocket communication for real-time updates and login credentials for secure access to the web interface. Additionally, the code features HTML pages stored in program memory, minimizing resource usage. The project facilitates the integration of IoT devices into a network, offering a practical demonstration of web-based control and monitoring capabilities.
